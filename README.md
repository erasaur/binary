Binary is a social network for debate, built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Check us out live at [binary10.co](https://binary10.co). 

## What the heck is this?
Here's the [simplest explanation](https://binary10.co/landing) we could think of.

## Why the heck would I use this?
We designed binary to be potentially beneficial to all sorts of people. In brief, it can be:

- **For developers.** Say you're making an app and wonder whether users would like a particular feature. Or suppose you've finally decided to settle the debate between vim and emacs. Create a topic on binary and users can vote and discuss the pros/cons!
- **For non-developers.** Debate on all sorts of topics ranging from politics (presidential elections are coming up!) to gaming. Heck you could even ask for [(shoddy) life advice](https://binary10.co/topics/iqw86XJPDuZjW3k7j).

## Contributing
We welcome any feedback/contributions! Feel free to drop us a line at `hi@binary10.co` and we'll get back to you within a few days. If you find any bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/erasaur/binary/issues). If you have feature requests or ideas, open an issue or send a [pull request](https://github.com/erasaur/binary/pulls) so we can discuss further.

Binary is based heavily on [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope), currently the most popular open-source Meteor app. If you have any experience contributing or using Telescope, the codebase should be familiar to you.
